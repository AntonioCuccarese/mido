Mido - an object oriented MIDI library for Python
==================================================

Mido is an object oriented MIDI library for Python 2 and 3.

Most Python MIDI libraries are thin wrappers around the underlying C
libraries. This usually means that you have to work directly with the
MIDI bytes. In Mido, you can instead use Python objects::

    >>> import mido
    >>> msg = mido.new('note_on', note=60, velocity=64)
    >>> msg.channel = 7
    >>> msg.note=127
    >>> msg
    mido.Message('note_on', channel=7, note=127, velocity=64, time=0)

Sending a message via PortMIDI::

    >>> from mido.portmidi import Output
    >>> out = Output()
    >>> out.send(msg)

Copying a message::

    >>> msg.copy(note=23, time=22)
    mido.Message('note_on', channel=7, note=23, velocity=64, time=22)


License
--------

Released under the MIT license.


Requirements
-------------

Mido uses PortMIDI for I/O. A wrapper module is included, so all you
need is is portmidi.so/dll installed on your system.

Tested with Python 2.7 and 3.3. (3.2 should be OK. Older versions may
or may not work.)

Runs on Linux 13.04 and Mac OS X 10.7.5. May also work on Windows.


Installing
-----------

In the Linux / OS X terminal::

    $ sudo python2 setup.py install

or::

    $ sudo python2 setup.py install


Known bugs
----------

  - on OS X, portmidi sometimes hangs for a couple of seconds while
    initializing.

  - in Linux, I sometimes experience short lags, as if messages
    are bunched up and then released again. I don't know what causes this,
    but I suspect that another process is sometimes stealing the CPU
    for long enough for this to happen. (Could it be garbage collection?
    I doubt it, but I won't rule it out yet.)

  - libportmidi prints out error messages instead of returns err and
    setting the error message string. This is stricly a bug in portmidi,
    but it trickles up.


Todo
-----

   - implement blocking or callbacks for Input ports

   - include some kind of event based scheduler?

   - include useful lookup tables or message attributes for common
     things like controller types

   - handle devices that send note_on(velocity=0) instead of
     note_off() (flag for portmidi.Input()?) Perhaps make it an option
     so you can choose the one you prefer, and any data will be
     converted to that format.

More in the TODO file.


More examples
--------------

One of these::

    $ sudo python2 setup.py install
    $ sudo python3 setup.py install


Default values for everything is 0 (and () for sysex data)::

    >>> mido.new('note_on')
    mido.Message('note_on', channel=0, note=0, velocity=0, time=0)
    >>> mido.new('sysex')
    mido.Message('sysex', data=(), time=0)

Encoding a message::

    >>> msg.bytes()
    [151, 60, 64]
    >>> msg.hex()
    '97 3C 40'
    >>> msg.bin()
    bytearray(b'\x97<@')

Sysex messages::

    >>> s = mido.new('sysex', data=[1, 2])
    >>> s.hex()
    'F0 01 02 F7'
    >>> s.data = (i for i in range(5))
    >>> s.data
    (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
    >>> s.hex()
    'F0 00 01 02 03 04 F7'

(Note that sysex messages contain the sysex_end byte (0xF7), so a
separate 'sysex_end' message is not necessary.)


Time
-----

The time attribute can be used for time annotations. Mido doesn't care
what you use it for, as long as it's a valid number. Examples::

    >>> msg.time = 183
    >>> msg.time = 220.84

The time attribute will not affect comparisons::

    >>> msg2 = msg.copy(time=20000)
    >>> msg == msg2
    True

More documentation is planned.
