Mido - MIDI Objects for Python
===============================

Mido is a library for working with MIDI messages and ports. It's
designed to be as straight forward and Pythonic as possible:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import mido
    >>> output = mido.open_output()
    >>> output.send(mido.Message('note_on', note=60, velocity=64))

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> with input as mido.open_input('SH-201'):
    ...     for msg in input:
    ...         print(msg)

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> msg = mido.Message('program_change', program=10)
    >>> msg.type
    'program_change'
    >>> msg.channel = 2
    >>> msg2 = msg.copy(program=9)
    <program_change message channel=2, program=9, time=0>

Status
-------

1.1 is the second stable release.

1.0 established the basic functionality (messages, ports and parser),
while 1.1 adds reading of MIDI files (with a convenient `play()`
method), MIDI over TCP/IP (socket ports) and many improvements to the
port API (including reset() and panic() methods for output ports.)


Requirements
-------------

Mido targets Python 2.7 and 3.2 and runs on Ubuntu and Mac OS X. May
also run on other systems.

If you want to use message ports, you will need `PortMidi
<http://sourceforge.net/p/portmedia/wiki/portmidi/>`_ installed on
your system. The PortMidi library is loaded on demand, so you can use
the parser and messages without it.

Alternative backends for pygame.midi and python-rtmidi are included in
the extras directory. You can choose which backend to use with an
environment variable::

    export MIDO_BACKEND=mido.backends.pygame
    python some_program.py


Installing
-----------

To install::

    $ pip install mido

The PortMidi wrapper is written with `ctypes`, so no compilation is
required.

If you want to use ports, you need the PortMidi shared library. The
Ubuntu package is called ``libportmidi-dev``, while the `MacPorts
<http://www.macports.org/>`_ and `Homebrew
<http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/>`_ packages are called ``portmidi``.

Known Bugs
-----------

* on OS X, PortMidi usually hangs for a second or two seconds while
  initializing. (It always succeeds.)

* (this is no longer a problem:) libportmidi prints out error messages
  instead of returning err and setting the error message string. Thus,
  Mido can't catch errors and raise the proper exception. I've been
  able to work around this when opening ports, which is the only place
  where this was a problem, as far as I know.

* there is an obscure bug involving the OS X application Midi Keys.
  See tmp/segfault.py.


Future Plans
-------------

* include multiple backends, and provide a way to choose which one to
  use, perhaps with `MIDO_BACKEND=portmidi` or some other mechanism.

* support for writing MIDI files.

* add a library of useful tools, such as delays, an event engine and
  message filters.

* support `running status
  <http://www.blitter.com/~russtopia/MIDI/~jglatt/tech/midispec/run.htm>`_
  (This is currently tricky or impossible with PortMidi, but could be
  useful for other data sources.)

* support time codes (0xf1). (These have one data bytes divided into 3
  bits type and 4 bits values. It's unclear how to handle this.)
