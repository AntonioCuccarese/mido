ProtoMIDI - a MIDI library for Python
======================================

ProtoMIDI aims to make it easy to write Python programs to manipulate
MIDI data, such as sequencers, patch editors or just experimental
scripts. A small example (API may change)::

    import time
    import random
    from protomidi.msg import *
    from protomidi.portmidi import Output

    # Play random notes
    out = Output()
    while 1:
        note = random.randrange(128)

        out.send(note_on(note=note, velocity=70))
	time.sleep(0.25)
	out.send(note_off(note=note))

MIDI messages are immutable objects. A new message can be created by
calling an existing message and overriding some of its values::

    >>> from protomidi.msg import note_on
    >>> msg = note_on(note=22, velocity=100)
    >>> msg
    note_on(channel=0, note=22, velocity=100)
    >>> msg(note=60)
    note_on(channel=0, note=60, velocity=100)


Planned features
----------------

(All implemented, but with a lot of testing and fine polishing remaining.)

    - abstract immutable MIDI message objects that are
      easy to work with
    - support for all MIDI message types (including sysex)
    - parser / serializer (seralizes to bytearray or bytes)
    - Input and Output classes for communicating with other MIDI programs or devices (portmidi)


Status
------

The library is under development. The code may not be stable and the
API may change.


Requirements
------------

ProtoMIDI will work with Python 2 and 3 (todo: be more specific).

Requires portmidi shared library if you want to use the I/O classes.


Todo
-----

   - figure out where to call portmidi.initialize()

   - include some kind of event based scheduler (perhaps based on
     http://github/olemb/gametime)

   - include useful lookup tables or message attributes for common things like
     controller types

   - handle devices that send note_on(velocity=0) instead of note_off() (flag
     for portmidi.Input()?) Perhaps make it an option so you can choose the one you prefer,
     and any data will be converted to that format.

   - attach some kind of time value to messages returned from Input.recv()? (Or should 
     the user pass a time function?)

   - do we actually need to set the timer in Input() and Output()?

   - show time value in __repr__()? Also, does assert_time handle time=None?


   - write docs

   - document the implementation of messages in msg.py.
     (the prototyping object model, how attributes are made read only etc.)
     This should be in docs/, not in in the msg.py.

   - write a short introduction on the MIDI protocol, using this library
     for examples
