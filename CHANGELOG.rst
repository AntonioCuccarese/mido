Change Log for Mido
====================

1.0.0 - 2013-07-20 - initial release
-------------------------------------

Complete implementation of all basic functionality: messages, ports
and parser. Includes experimental versions of backends (wrappers) for
pygame-midi and python-rtmidi.

The API is frozen, and can be relied on to not change in the future,
with the exception of how ports are subclassed. (The author will
resist even small changes, unless they are absolutely necessary.)
